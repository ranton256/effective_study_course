Today we are focusing on learning how to use the [Method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci). This is also known as the memory palace technique or sometimes as the journey method.

Our ancestors had little need to memorize lists of presidents, learn abstract mathematical concepts, or memorize complex piano solos. They did have a strong need to process a large amount of visual information and keep track of where they saw food and predators and how to return to their family and tribe.   Probably for related reasons, we have a much larger natural capacity to remember visual information, especially when tied to spatial relationships.  We also remember stories and narratives that we relate to more easily than static, dry concepts. 

First, we need to prepare a memory palace. This is a place you are very familiar with that you construct a repeatable mental path through so that there are stations at different points. For getting started, it is easiest to use somewhere you have lived and keep the stops on your journey limited to rooms or major features. 

This is a somewhat personal process, but to make it concrete let’s make up a room order of walking through an imaginary home.



1. Front door and entry area
2. Kitchen
3. Living room
4. Hallway
5. Bedroom 2
6. Master bedroom
7. Utility closet

For a first set of things to remember, let’s use the seven wonders of the ancient world.



1. Great pyramid of Giza
2. Hanging gardens of Babylon
3. Statue of Zeus at Olympia
4. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
5. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
6. Colossus of Rhodes
7. Lighthouse of Alexandria

_You walk up to the front door, there is a huge pyramid engraved into its surface with a very old man holding it up; he is a gee-za (Giza)._

_As you enter the front door you are in the kitchen, where Margot Robbie’s character from the movie Babylon is tending to an elaborate, beautiful garden of plants hanging from the ceiling all around the kitchen area._

_As you pass Margot into the living room, a statuesque Zeus is sitting on the couch intently watching the summer Olympics on your television._

_You leave this strange scene for the hallway, where Artemis, the goddess of the hunt is stalking an animal that is apparently inside the hallway coat closet. She whispers us to shoo and says “it sees us” (rhymes with Ephesus)_

_Tiptoeing away you take refuge in the first, smaller bedroom to your right where there is Hali Berry (Hali-carnassus) sitting on top of a large ornate stone tomb since apparently the bedroom has been converted to a mausoleum._

_Next, you go into the master bedroom where a huge man is standing inside, with each foot on a different Hot Wheels playset with roads. Looking closer you realize it is Colossus from the X-Men._

_Leaving the master bedroom, you hear a sound coming from the utility closet, opening the door to peer inside you see that Alexander the Great (founder of Alexandria) is working on your water heater, which he seems to have somehow converted into a blindingly bright lighthouse._

Walk through this in your mind, adjusting the locations to match somewhere you are familiar with as needed. Then practice recalling it. Active recall is essential to forming and maintaining durable memories.  If you want to remember this permanently use a spaced repetition scheme based on the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). There are various schedules and methods for spaced repetition, but for this, I would recommend keeping it very simple. 

For this 7 wonders list, you could try doing this twice the first day, once the next day, again several days later, then once a week for a few times, then set a calendar reminder to do it once a month for a few months, then test yourself at some prescheduled time months out to see how well it sticks.
