2. What does the "Z" in the list of noble gases stand for?
3. Can you list the noble gasses in order using what you just learned?

In 1885 Hermann Ebbinghaus published the results of a study he conducted on himself on how memory of new information was affected by the passage of time. His results have largely held up against time and for subsequent related studies showing that we forget memorized information over time subject to a certain function. (Murre & Dros, 2015). This is known as the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

The equation from Ebbinghaus’s publication is:


$$y=\frac{100k}{\left((\log (t))^c+k\right)}$$


And the values observed for c=1.25 and k=1.84 this is:



$$y=\frac{100(1.84)}{\left((\log (t))^{1.25}+1.84\right)}$$

Y axis is percent of information recalled. X axis is days since information was learned.

Spaced repetition systems take advantage of the effects of the forgetting curve and the testing effect to use active recall and self-testing to strengthen memories before they decay completely. This aligns with research showing that testing on material improves memory more than studying it, and using the evidence from studies on the time to forget new information uses your time more efficiently.

This should also be done with interleaved practice because remembering the correct thing in a different context is more difficult than when you know exactly the concept from the context. Such as remembering a greeting in a foreign language on a subway, compared to in a German class.

A space repetition system, together with interleaved retrieval practice plus some good organization and habit engineering is my recommendation for long-term learning and recall.

This lesson is more prescriptive to help beginners get started, but you should adjust your system once you have gotten further along.

Choose a spaced repetition system. I recommend one of three choices. 



1. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - this is the most well-known, free software for supporting SRS.
2. [Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/) - this is another free tool for supporting SRS.
3. [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) - this is a card-and-box non-software system if you prefer a tactile, low-tech method.

None of these cost money, but they all take some time to set up.

If you prefer you can use Google Sheets, Notion, or other tools that allow for scripting or automation to build your own. Another popular tool for spaced repetition and retrieval practices is [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/features/how-quizlet-works).

A technique that can help with your studying is to use Claude.ai or ChatGPT to create flash card lists. For example, you can create tab-delimited files of two columns of questions/answers and import these into Mnemosyne. I have also successfully used ChatGPT to generate vocabulary study card sets pre-formatted for import into Anki. 

Other ways you can actively recall and use information to get a self-testing effect include:



* Create quizzes for yourself to take later
* Summarize the material into your own words from memory
* Do practice problems for subjects like math or physics
* Close your eyes after each page and remember as much of the concept as you can.
* Teach the concepts to someone else
* Explain the concept to a “[rubber duck](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dear-life-please-improve/202312/stuck-ask-a-rubber-duck)”
