title: Concepts and Overview

---
This brief course will introduce you to methods for using your memory and other cognitive skills more effectively.  We will begin by introducing some concepts and terminology, and we will introduce some interesting historical research at times to keep things interesting, but we will focus on learning pragmatic skills.

For the first lesson, we are going to cover some concepts and background and an overview of what we will learn. But there will be practical advice and examples as well.

**Concepts**

We will introduce concepts related to effective learning in this lesson.

**Getting the Most from this Course**

Please use the concepts covered in this course to improve your learning and retention of this course itself!

We will keep it simple. Please try to do these specific actions to get the most out of your time.



1. After reading each new lesson, close your eyes and recall as much of it as you can.
2. Do the review questions at the beginning of each of the lessons (after this one).
3. Stick to the schedule of the course.
4. Create a plan for your next learning project or class with goals, schedule, materials, and tracking.

**The Myth of Multitasking**

First, let‚Äôs talk a bit about focus and productivity before we get into memory directly. There is a commonly held myth that some people are better at multitasking. This is not really true if you are talking about two or more tasks that require any dedicated thought. This has been supported by numerous studies. We like to think we can do two things well, but even when one of those things is fairly automatic another task interferes with our effectiveness. Actually, around 2.5% of people have been shown to be actually far better at multitasking than the rest of us, but most people who believe they are good at multitasking are not actually in this group.

Why is this relevant? Because the first step in remembering something is to pay attention to it in the first place, and if your focus is not good, it will be hard to create the initial short-term memory of what you are trying to learn.

**Right living:** better focus through sleep, rest, and mindfulness

Our cognitive performance including the ability to focus, recall information, and make good decisions depends on getting good sleep and managing our health, including our nutrition and state of mind. Mindfulness is a helpful area for managing stress from my experience and supported by some research, but it is not the only way.  Exercising regularly is a very reliable way to improve your mental and physical well-being, including cognitive function. It is also hopeful for dealing with stress.

**Counterintuitive truths about learning**

We all feel like we are learning when we read, listen, or watch new material or reread and revise it. The same is true for highlighting text. Unfortunately, what feels like success when studying is misleading. What works better is to practice active recall, forcing yourself to retrieve the new information from memory, and preferably use it in practice where applicable.

Interleaving practice of different topics or subtopics strengthens your ability to recall the correct information. This is the difference between being able to do something you just learned in math class in the same lesson and remembering the correct formula and why it applies to a problem on a final exam.  

It is quite important when you study, not just how or how much.  Studying 15 minutes on four different days will yield better results for long-term retention than studying 60 minutes at once. There is also a concept known as the forgetting curve that shows that the more times we have tested ourselves and recalled something the longer the interval becomes before we need to do so again. This is the basis of spaced repetition systems which we will go into in more depth in one of the lessons of this course in the lesson on maintaining memories.

**Short-term versus long-term memory**

We have short-term memory, including working memory, which is the information we are actively using for the cognitive task at hand.  Our working memory is limited to a fairly low number of items at once, called chunks, but these items can be almost any size with the limit of what a ‚Äúchunk‚Äù can be determined by how deeply you have built your understanding of the knowledge involved. This was first discussed by Miller in 1956 (Miller, 1956).  For example, if you are a car nut, you can remember a list of seven specific models of sports cars (year, make, model, color) without much more difficulty than a preschooler can remember seven colors of cars.

For short-term memory to become long-term memory, which is anything you can access after more than a few minutes, it goes through a process of encoding, storage, and retrieval.

Our minds perceive and store different modalities of information in different ways. The repeating of verbal information like a grocery list or a phone number you are trying to remember is called the phonological loop.

Visual and spatial information, such as a painting, a route through a neighborhood to the store, or a sequence of images you have visualized mentally is managed in a part of working memory called the visuospatial sketchpad. There is experimental evidence supporting that these systems function separately based on experiments where different types of tasks are done at the same time and which ones interfere with the performance of others.

The third type of working memory is called the episodic buffer, which relates to how humans can remember a story or narrative much more easily than abstract facts. In a lot of ways, our memory is a series of stories we recall about our life.

Our executive function or central executive is the part of our mind responsible for managing our focus and working memory.  It directs the other components in this model, which we should point out is only a model. It is supported by empirical evidence in terms of how it appears to function, but it is only an approximation of how our extremely complex minds actually function.

We are much better at remembering visual information, especially if it is related to spatial relationships, and/or a story-like sequence of events.

There are also different types of memory even when we are talking about long-term memory.

We have both declarative memory, which is explicit knowledge of things and events and procedural memory, which is the learned ability to perform tasks requiring skills or practice. Procedural memory includes the ability to drive a car or ride a bike or play golf. Declarative memory is further divided into semantic memory and episodic memory. Semantic memory includes concepts and information such as what valence electrons are and how to solve an algebraic equation. Episodic memory includes our recall of events in the past, including first person experiences.

Here is a graphic to help you remember the different components of our long term memory and working memory systems.
