Welcome to the LearnedMemory study techniques course!

Thanks for joining us on this journey of self-improvement. I find nothing more satisfying than mastering new skills 
while learning new things. I am guessing you are at least a bit similar in that regard if you are reading along.

We all experience the frustration of forgetting someoneâ€™s name, struggling to remember dates for a history test, 
or forgetting the list of items at the grocery store. And then there is all the information to handle in a modern 
career. All of this is constantly under siege from notifications from smartphone apps, emails, instant messages at 
work, and other assaults of modern life on your attention span in profit-driven attempts to pull in your attention 
rather than let you focus. And of course, the open-plan office, which I believe is founded on a myth of improved 
productivity but in reality is intended to reduce costs of office real estate while robbing most people of their 
ability to focus.
