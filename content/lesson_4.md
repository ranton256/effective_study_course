**Review Quiz: Using Visualization**

1. What is another name for the Method of Loci?
2. Why are humans better at remembering visual information, especially when tied to spatial relationships?
3. What are the 7 ancient wonders of the world?

For a small example, let’s use the list of [Noble gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas), which if you recall are the gaseous elements on the far right hand of the periodic table such as neon, that do not react chemically very easily with other elements because of their complete outer shell of valence electrons.

They are in order of atomic number, denoted Z in this list.

1. [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium) (He) Z=2
2. [neon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon) (Ne) Z=10
3. [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon) (Ar) Z=18
4. [krypton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton) (Kr) Z=36
5. [xenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon) (Xe) Z=54
6. [radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon) (Rn) Z=86

There is also a theoretically another possible noble gas, atomic number 118, [oganesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oganesson). It has been synthesized, but its chemical properties are not yet known, so we are not going to include it for our purposes.

Let’s try using the [rhyming peg system](https://www.learnedmemory.com/articles/rhyming-peg-mnemonic-system) to recall these in order.



1. Helium is found in the **Sun**
2. Neon lights can be **blue**
3. Slowly **freeze** **bees** in a **tree **using Argon** (_this one is rough, I know)_**
    1. Argon is a refrigerant
    2. Argos (αργός) is Greek for slow.
4. Superman is **sore** about Krypton exploding, or Superman can’t open the Krypton-ite **door**
5. The xenophobic **tribe** attacks outsiders with **knives**
6. **Fix** the radon leak to save the **chicks (_in the coop?_**)

These are not the simplest things to place in a rhyming peg list, but you see with a little effort we still can.

To make it more memorable let’s try to construct an episodic narrative we can visualize.

_“The alien sun shines its blue light through the leaves of the tree of slowly freezing bees where Superman sits underneath contemplating the tribe of xenophobes nearby waiting with knives out to attack him if he comes through the door, but meanwhile the radon leak in the building is slowly killing them.”_
