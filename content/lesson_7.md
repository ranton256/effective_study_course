**Congratulations on sticking with this course!**

Letâ€™s briefly review what we have covered, and then we will close with some further resources for you to continue your journey.

We covered concepts of working memory, and how memory, focus, and environmental factors like sleep affect your cognitive abilities.

We covered some basic tips for reading for better comprehension as well as reading more quickly. The key point is to scan ahead for comprehension, use active recall to test your knowledge after reading a page, and remember the tips for getting your eyes to track faster so that you can read more quickly.

We went through the Method of Loci technique and built a memory palace so that you can use visuaspatial memory to improve your recall.

We learned about the rhyming peg technique for memorizing lists. An additional peg system you can learn is the alphabet peg system covered in [How to Create Alphabet Peg Lists | Art of Memory](https://artofmemory.com/blog/alphabet-peg-lists/) 

We talked about deliberate difficulty, the forgetting curve, active recall, interleaved practice, and how to practically integrate the implications of these into a spaced repetition system (SRS) by hand or with software. 

Lastly, we covered the major mnemonic system for remembering numbers.  This is a system you have to invest in up front a bit, but it pays off fairly quickly. An alternative to the major system is the [Dominic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_system) 

Some additional techniques we did not go into that I would recommend if you want to go farther are linking and the PAO system.



* Linking - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system)
* The Person-Action-Object (PAO) system, [Person-Action-Object (PAO) System | Art of Memory](https://artofmemory.com/blog/pao-system/) 

I also highly recommend the book _[Moonwalking with Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530)_ by Joshua Foer (2012). It is both a fun book as well as having enough information on the memory techniques to actually try them out.

To help you remember the concepts and information we have here, you can download our

[10 Concepts for effective learning Infographic](https://www.learnedmemory.com/ten_concepts_for_effective_learning.pdf) which is suitable for printing if you want to pin it up in your work or study area.
