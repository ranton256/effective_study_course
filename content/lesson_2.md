5. What is the Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two?

Reading efficiently for comprehension is an important skill for learning. After all, you can only remember what you have learned in the first place, and conceptual understanding is important to most subjects besides just retention of information.

A few tips for reading more quickly that you can adopt easily and incrementally are:

1. Use a pencil or pen to track the current word at a consistent speed. You can force your eyes to track a bit faster this way, which is one of the bottlenecks of reading.
2. Use your peripheral vision by starting one word into each line and stopping one word before the end when moving the focus of your eyes.
3. Avoid subvocalizing the words. Sounding out the words, even in your mind, is not entirely necessary for understanding what you read, but most of us learn to do it when we learn to read as children.
4. Practice viewing words in a chunk of several words instead of stopping your eyes on each word. Your peripheral vision and visual perception will handle the rest for you with some practice.

To improve comprehension of what you read it is important to use some form of active recall and self-testing which leads to better retention of information than just reading or rereading.

The **PQRST** technique is a method used to study more effectively by actively engaging with the material. Here's how to use it:



1. **Preview**: Before diving into the material, take a moment to preview it. Skim through headings, subheadings, and any summaries or key points. This gives you an overview of what to expect and helps you set a mental framework for understanding.
2. **Question**: Formulate questions based on the material you've previewed. What do you want to learn or understand better? Write down these questions to guide your study session and focus your attention on key concepts.
3. **Read**: Read the material actively and attentively. Pay close attention to details, examples, and explanations. Take notes or highlight important points as you go along. Try to answer the questions you formulated during the preview stage.
4. **Summarize**: After reading a section or completing a study session, summarize the main points in your own words. This helps reinforce your understanding and retention of the material. Focus on capturing the key ideas and concepts rather than every detail.
5. **Test**: Test yourself on the material to assess your understanding and retention. Use the questions you formulated earlier or create new ones based on the material. Practice active recall by trying to answer the questions without referring back to the text.

By following the PQRST technique, you actively engage with the material at every stage of the process. This helps deepen your understanding and improve retention.  A similar approach is [SQR3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.

A study on PQRST compared to normal reading found that “As time passes, recall rates decreased in normal reading but increased in reading with PQRST” though immediate retention of information was about the same (Aygören, 2020). In other words, PQRST will help you retain the information longer, but will not make you more effective when cramming in the near term.

I also recommend the article [The Four Levels of Reading: Improve Skills One Level At A Time](https://fs.blog/levels-of-reading/?utm_source=www.learnedmemory.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=improving-your-reading) which covers the basic concepts in the classic _[How to Read a Book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095) (Adler & Doren, 1972)._
