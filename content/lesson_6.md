There are various systems devised throughout the years for remembering sequences of numbers. These systems are used in world memory competitions and for setting new records for the most digits of pi someone can remember and recite successfully. One of the more popular and well established ones is the [major system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system).  It is not the most powerful, but it is a nice balance of the up front investment required with the results you can gain.  

The system works by associating consonant sounds with specific digits. You use the consonants for the number sequence you want to remember to form words by substituting in vowels. It takes a bit of practice, and it requires memorizing the consonant associations, but they are setup so most of the digits are related to the sounds in some way that helps you remember.


**Digit	Letter**

* **0	s, z, soft c**
* **1	t, d, th**
* **2	n**
* **3	m**
* **4	r**
* **5	L(l)**
* **6	j, soft g, soft ch, sh**
* **7	k, hard c, hard g, hard ch, q, ck, qu**
* **8	v, f, ph**
* **9	p, b**

Usually we take the digits two at a time to make words or sometimes syllables of words, but we can also do three at once or a single consonant word when we have an odd number of digits.

Remember that the consonants are sounds, not necessarily exact letters.

Let’s say we want to remember the phone number 867-5309 .

We could split this into 4 words, 3 pairs with 1 single consonant first.


- **f=8**
- **ch=6, g=7**
- **5=l, 3=m**
- **0=s, 9=p**

We could choose this as our mnemonic phrase. It is quite easy to visualize.

It takes some practice to be easier to produce the words for the consonants. I recommend struggling through it yourself most of the time, but if you get stuck there is a helpful site at [https://major-system.info/](https://major-system.info/) that can give you words for a specific number.

To become more proficient at the system you can pre-create a word for each of the 100 two-digit combinations.

It is important to tie the words together in some way you can remember in order. Visualizing some sequence of actions like a story is usually best for longer sequences but for shorter ones a memorable phrase or sentence will do as long as it keeps the order obvious.
